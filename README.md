## Additional tips

* If you cloned the repo to some place other than your home directory, modify the variable `dir` in the script to suit your needs.

* If you want to add or remove files to be linked, modify [files](files).

* You can link individual files by providing their names as arguments to the script.

* To get completions with the available files when running the script, run:
```bash
source ~/dotfiles/makelinks-completion
```
